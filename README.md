A portfolio of projects in Python, R, and SQL demonstrating applied statistics, data science, and visualization skills.

## [Project 1: Smoking Behavior Prediction Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/snigdhapakala/Smoking-Behavior-ML)

This is a project I did during my master's program that analyzes smoking behavior through interpretable machine learning techniques, using the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. 

- **Data:**  Over 300,000 records from BRFSS, including demographic, health, and behavioral features.
- **Techniques:** one-hot/ordinal/custom encoding, z-score normalization
- **Algorithms:** Logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network with 2 hidden layers, ReLU activation, and dropout regularization
- **Modeling:** SHAP values, permutation importance, t-SNE visualization, ablation studies
- **Evaluation metrics:** ROC AUC, Brier Score, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Calibration curves, Expected Calibration Error (ECE)  

The comprehensive approach balances predictive power with interpretability, offering insights into smoking risk factors valuable for public health interventions.
