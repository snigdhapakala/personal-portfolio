# Snigdha Pakala's Portfolio
A portfolio of projects in Python, R, and SQL demonstrating applied statistics, data science, and visualization skills.

## [Project 1: Smoking Behavior Prediction Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/snigdhapakala/Smoking-Behavior-ML)

This is a project I did during my master's program that analyzes smoking behavior through interpretable machine learning techniques, using the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. 

- **Data:**  Over 300,000 records from BRFSS, including demographic, health, and behavioral features.
- **Techniques:** one-hot/ordinal/custom encoding, z-score normalization
- **Algorithms:** Logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network with 2 hidden layers, ReLU activation, and dropout regularization
- **Modeling:** SHAP values, permutation importance, t-SNE visualization, ablation studies
- **Evaluation metrics:** ROC AUC, Brier Score, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Calibration curves, Expected Calibration Error (ECE)  

The comprehensive approach balances predictive power with interpretability, offering insights into smoking risk factors valuable for public health interventions.

## [Project 2: Pneumococcal Vaccination Campaign Analysis with Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling](https://github.com/snigdhapakala/Bayesian_Statistics_Vaccination_Campaign_Effectiveness)

This is a project from my master’s program using R that evaluates pneumococcal vaccination campaign effectiveness using Bayesian hierarchical statistical modeling on CDC BRFSS data (2018–2021).

- **Data:** CDC BRFSS survey (2018–2021), adult vaccination coverage stratified by geography, demographics, and time period  
- **Techniques:**  Bayesian hierarchical modeling, STAN for Bayesian inference with prior/posterior predictive checks  
- **Statistical & Data Science Methods:** Binomial likelihood with logit link, Region-specific intercepts with global hyperpriors, MCMC parametric estimation
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Convergence diagnostics (Rhat, ESS, trace plots, autocorrelation)

## [Project 3: Statistical Analysis of Emergency Service Claims by Income Category](https://github.com/snigdhapakala/Statistical-Analysis-Emergency-Claims-Income)

This project analyzes the relationship between socioeconomic status and frequency of emergency service claims using Medicare and IRS income data.

- **Data**: Combines 2022 Medicare Physician Other Practitioners claims data with ZIP code-level Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) from IRS
- **Scope**: Examines disparities in emergency service use across high-poverty and affluent ZIP codes defined by income brackets
- **Methods**: Data cleaning, merging datasets, EDA, log transformation for skewness reduction, normalization of claim frequencies per beneficiary group
- **Statistical Analysis**: Linear regression with heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors, Welch two-sample t-test comparing claim rates, Residual diagnostics including Q-Q plots and tests for normality and homoscedasticity

The project provides a statistical framework combining regression modeling with robust inference and comprehensive visualization to examine income-based disparities in emergency healthcare usage.
